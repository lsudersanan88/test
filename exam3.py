Exam 3

* You will receive a -10% Penalty if your exam cannot be imported and I must open your exam to test it
* Corrections can be done late for up to 75% of your earned score and
   must be completed before the final exam date (see syllabus).
* Grades will be posted on or before Friday (for exam 2 AND 3)
* Class is canceled on Wednesday (5/1)
* The final exam will not contain any extra material, but it is cumulative
* The final exam will (probably) be slightly longer than exam 2,
   but you will have an extra hour and some of the material will be easy (exam 1 material)
* Grading is described in the syllabus, if you have a question about your final grade,
   check there first. I will ignore emails with questions that are answered literally and directly in the syllabus
